Micro Chat Room App is for people to communicate and vote for ideas. Does this sounds familiar: You and your friends(maybe more than 10) are discussing what to do in the weekend. Some people say they want to go hiking, some prefer wine tasting, and some want to have party at home, and they hate hiking, even though hiking seems most popular. So the chat history is so long, that you spend quite a few minutes to figure out which plan is acceptable by most people. And then you and your friends spend more time on coming up with an idea that everyone is happy with. 

However, with Micro Chat Room, the decision seems very easy to make! Participants can vote to any message -- like it or dislike it. Even with a large group as 30 people (the upper bound of capacity the room) , the chat history can still keep short, and the votes help you make a quick and wise decision.

Features:
1. New users need to register first. Profile image is optional in registration. After registration, they can log in and enter the room. 
3. The user will be informed about the progress and result of log in and registration.
2. Tutorial is available to any user any time.
3. When a user enters the room, he is able to see the chat history.

5. User can vote to any messages, with 2 voting options: smile face--like, sad face--dislike. User can also cancel the voting that he made.
6. The participants list is displayed so the users would know who they are chatting with.
7. User can log out/leave the room to exit the conversion. If a user leaves the room, other participants will see his name disappearing from the participants list.
